# The-Maze

Hi! and Welcome to The Maze. This is a piece of work which will help you to visualize graphs in a better way. I had fun building it and had learned a lot hope so do you. I hope you enjoy it.https://zaidxdxd.github.io/The-Maze-/. 


***Algorithm Used To Solve The Maze***

   Breadth-First-Search
   Dijkstra's Agorithm 
   Left-Wall-Follower
   Right-Wall-Follower
   A-Star Algorithm.
  
***Maze Creating Algorithms***

   Depth-First-Search
   Binary Tree Traversal
   Prim's Algorithm
